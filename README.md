## Description

This chatbot used to provide an interaction with the user. Help user can set their own strategy in an online game, and if the game confirms the user's strategy, the chatbot will send a notice immediately.

I trained an object detection model to detect the game's screen and use an algorithm to avoid overlapping and sort the result.
